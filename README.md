### Usage
- `python main.py`
    - Fetches the current state of your Dualis Account, saves it and detects any changes.

    - It doesn't print out any console output, but it writes into `DualisWatcher.log`.
- `python main.py --init`
    - Guides you trough the configuration of the software, including the activation of mail-notifications and obtainment of a login-token for your Dualis-Account.
    - It also fetches the current state of your Dualis-Account. (But it will not check for any changes to a possible previous state.)
    - It prints all information into the console.
- `python main.py --new-token`
    - Overrides the login-token with a newly obtained one.
    - It does not fetch the current state of your Dualis-Account.
    - Use it if at any point in time, for whatever reason, the saved token gets rejected by Dualis.
    - It does not affect the rest of the config.
    - It prints all information into the console.

            "email": "wi@dhbw.de",
            "password": "test123"
        }
        ```

### Notes
- Use a separate E-Mail - Account for sending out the notifications, as its login data is saved in cleartext.
- The Login-Information for your Dualis-Account is secure, it isn't saved in any way. Only a Login-Token is saved.
- Use the following crontab schedule to reduce the load on Dualis (polls every hour on working days, but requires you to hardcode the token, as the session will be expired every time):
    - ```shell
      0 8-18 * * 1-5 cd DualisWatcher && source env/bin/activate && python3 main.py --new-token --email wi@dhbw.de --password test123 && python3 main.py
      ```
